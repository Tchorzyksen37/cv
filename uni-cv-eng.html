                        <p>
                            In 2016, I began my studies at the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology at Warsaw University of Technology, 
                            pursuing a degree in Computer Science taught in English. During my first year, 
                            I was a member of the Faculty Student Council of EiTI and delegated to the Information and Promotion Committee (KIP). 
                            In the third semester, I decided to learn the Java programming language, and shortly thereafter, 
                            I obtained my first job in the industry. In the following years, I balanced my professional development 
                            with academic responsibilities. I advanced in the corporate ladder, which required greater commitment to my professional work, 
                            resulting in a delay in completing my undergraduate studies. Finally, in 2022, I submitted my thesis titled 
                            “Exploring the COVID-19 Patient Database and Developing an Expert System” and passed the exam with a result above good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I work as a programmer in the position of Senior Software Engineer at the newly opened branch of the international
                             corporation Visa. My responsibilities include maintaining and developing web applications. 
                             My plan is to advance in the field of distributed systems architecture and explore how 
                             artificial intelligence (AI) can change the world and impact the services offered to end users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Despite working on systems and applications, I do not shy away from manual tasks such as building circuits, 
                            connecting cables, or soldering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My expectations for my master's studies are to expand my knowledge in system development and artificial intelligence. 
                            I seek to work on engaging projects that provide opportunities for creative thinking and encourage the effort involved
                            in acquiring new knowledge.
                        </p>

                        <h2>INTREESTS</h2>
                        <p>
                            In my free time, I am active in the Student Sailing Club of Warsaw University of Technology (SKŻ). 
                            I am licensed to operate inland and maritime yachts. My goal is to lead an independent sea voyage.
                            My interests also include rollerblading and ice skating. From 2017 to 2019, I was a member of the Night Skating Team, 
                            which organizes night rollerblading rides through the streets of Warsaw. In the evenings, 
                            I also work on my own web application and solve various coding challenges like Advent of Code and tasks on the LeetCode platform.
                            In summary, I enjoy learning new patterns, gaining knowledge, and sharing it with others.
